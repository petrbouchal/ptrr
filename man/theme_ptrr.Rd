\usage{
theme_ptrr(
  gridlines = c("y", "x", "both", "scatter", "none"),
  base_size = 11,
  family = "IBM Plex Sans Condensed",
  title_family = "IBM Plex Sans",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gridlines}{Whether to display major gridlines along `"y"` (the default),
`"x"`, `"both"` or draw a `"scatter"`, which has both gridlines and inverted colours.}

\item{base_size}{Numeric text size in pts, affects all text in plot. Defaults to 11.}

\item{family, title_family}{font family to use for the (title of the) plot. Defaults to `"IBM Plex Sans"` for title and `"IBM Plex Sans Condensed"` for plot.}

\item{multiplot}{if set to TRUE, provides better styling for small multiples created using `facet_*`.}

\item{margin_side, margin_bottom}{size of left and right / bottom margin around plot, in pts. Defaults to 6. Set to 0 to align flush with text in a Word document.}

\item{plot.title.position}{where to align the title. Either "plot" (the default, difference from `theme()` default) or `"panel"`.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to `theme()`.}

\item{axis.title}{same as in theme(), but with a default of `element_blank()`.}

\description{
A wrapper around `theme()` which provides several shortcuts to setting common options
and several defaults. See more in Details.
}
\details{
In particular, the theme:
- displays only major gridlines, allowing you to quickly switch which ones; gridlines are thinner, panel has white background
- provides quick option to draw a scatter with grey background
- switches defaults for title alignment
- turns axis labels off by default: in practice, x axes are often obvious and
y axes are better documented in a subtitle
- sets backgrounds to a ptrr-style shade
- sets plot title in bold and 120% of base_size

All the changed defaults can be overriden by another call to `theme()`.
}
\note{
The default fonts - IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Sans Condensed - are contained in this package and
can be registered with the system using `import_fonts()`. You should then install them onto your
system like any font, using files in the directories described in the `import_fonts()` messsage.
You can also set the  `ptrr.loadfonts` option to TRUE for the fonts
to be registered at package load.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)

# NB when `theme_ptrr()` is used in these examples, fonts
# are set to 'sans' to pass checks on computers without the
# sans included. If you have these fonts (see Note) you can
# leave these parameters at their default values.
